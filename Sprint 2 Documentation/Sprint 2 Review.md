# Sprint 2 Review  
## What we completed in Sprint 2
CHANGE ALL THIS LATER TO WHAT WE DID
* Created and implemented 3D models for Pac-Man and the Ghosts
* Created wall object with a texture similar to the original game
* Attatched camera to player (it follows the player around)
* Player rotates to face direction of travel
* Adjusted demo movement to be relative to camera
* Created Pellet and Power Pellet Game Objects
  * Touching a pellet deletes it and makes the player score go up
  * Touching a power pellet deletes it, makes the score go up, and changes ghosts from "Chase" mode to "Scatter" mode (unimplemented)

## What went well?
* Mob programming went very well
* Sprint planning and completing on schedule
  * Product backlog refinement
  * Time Management
* "Daily" sprint standups were asynchronous 

## What do we want to continue to do moving forward?  
* Asynchronous standups
* Mob programming sessions
* Schedule management

## What didn't go well?
* Communication
* Availability
* GameCI impementation

## What do we need to change?
* Everyone needs to be communicating in the Teams chat
* Everyone needs to show up to agreed upon meeting times
* Being more proactive to take initiative on tasks
