## CI/CD
We've attempted to set up a GameCI GitHub action (located in .github/workflows/main.yml) that on push builds our project and creates a GitHub Release.  We've had a lot of issues making it work, and we will continue to try to fix it as we move forward.  
The current demo is still currently a GitHub Relase, as well as existing in the Sprint 2 Documentation folder.
