## CI/CD
We've got GameCI working to build the game on push, but we haven't gotten it to deploy ad a GitHub release as we originally planned.  We're working out the bugs, but for now we're manually deploying the releases.
The current demo is still currently a GitHub Relase, as well as existing in the Sprint 2 Documentation folder.
