# Regarding the Comments from Critiques 
In response to the feedback regarding the camera angles in our 3D Pac-Man remake, our team has implemented several changes to enhance the player's experience. First and foremost, we have introduced a top-down view option for players who prefer a broader perspective of the game board. This view allows players to have a clearer understanding of their surroundings, particularly when navigating the upper regions of the maze. By incorporating this feature, we aim to address the challenge of visibility that arises when the player moves further away from the camera.
 
Furthermore, we have introduced additional camera angles to provide players with more flexibility in choosing their preferred point-of-view. In addition to the traditional angled camera, players now have the option to switch to a first-person view or a slight over-the-shoulder perspective, reminiscent of popular racing games like Mario Kart. These new camera angles not only add variety to the gameplay but also offer a fresh and immersive experience for players who seek a different vantage point.
