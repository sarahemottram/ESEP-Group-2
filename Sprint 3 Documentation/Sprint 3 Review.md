# Sprint 3 Review  
## What we completed in Sprint 3
* Player collision with ghosts in scatter mode
  * Ghosts flip and go back to spawn area  
* Left-Right continuity
  * Pac-Man teleports from one side to the other
* Music and Sound  
  * "Waka" sound plays when Pac-Man is eating pellets  
  * "Death" sound plays when Pac-Man touches a ghost in chase mode
  * "Siren" sound plays when ghosts are in scatter
  * "Ghost Death" sound plays when Pac-Man eats a ghost in scatter mode
  * "Intro" plays at the beginning and after each soft reset
  * Music loops until win or loss
  * "Win" sound plays when player has completed the game
* Ghost Movement
  * Created a NavMesh and made all ghosts NavMeshAgents so ghosts can move
  * Blinky chases Pac-Man and scatters to top left
  * Pinky chases above or below Pac-Man depending on where he is and scatters to bottom right
  * Inky chases the midpoint between Blinky and Pac-Man and scatters to top right
  * Clyde chases Pac-Man until he's too close, then goes to his scatter position and scatters to bottom left
