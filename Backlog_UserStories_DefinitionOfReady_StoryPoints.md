Each item in the backlog is a User Story (elaborated in the description) containing the definition of ready (in the acceptance criteria) and Story Points (under planning).  

# Backlog Order Rationale
We've ordered our backlog based on 3 main ideas:  
1. What we need for core functionality (1-11)  
2. What we need to make the game a game (12-18)  
3. Extra things that will help make the game better, but not neccesary to functionality or gameplay (19-24)
