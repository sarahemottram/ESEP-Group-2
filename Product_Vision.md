# Pac-Man Remake Far Vision

## Overview

In the distant future, our remade Pac-Man game will stand as a timeless tribute to the iconic arcade classic, providing players with an immersive and nostalgic experience. We envision a game that not only captures the essence of the original but elevates it with modern graphics, sound, and gameplay mechanics.

## Maze Layout

Our far vision includes a comprehensive recreation of the original maze layout, faithfully replicating the walls and pathways that players fondly remember. The ghosts will not only move intelligently but possess 3D models reminiscent of the classic characters, enhancing the nostalgic journey for players.

## Strategic Gameplay

To add depth to the gameplay, we plan to introduce strategic elements such as power dots, collectable dots, and multiple levels. Players will feel a sense of accomplishment as they progress through each level, collecting dots and strategically using power dots to turn the tide against the ghosts.

## Immersive Experience

The immersive experience will extend to visuals and sounds, with a 3D representation of Pac-Man, iconic sound effects, and a rendition of the original music that transports players back to the Pac-Man world. We aspire to create a game where every aspect, from visuals to gameplay mechanics, pays homage to the original while offering a fresh and captivating experience.

# Pac-Man Remake Near Vision

## Overview

In the near term, our focus is on developing the core elements outlined in the user stories to create a playable prototype that embodies the spirit of the classic Pac-Man game. We will meticulously design the maze with walls that mirror the original, ensuring a familiar yet engaging challenge for players.

## Ghost Behavior

The ghosts will be programmed to move intelligently, and 3D models will be created to faithfully represent the iconic characters. A power dot system will be implemented to give players a means of combating the ghosts, fostering a sense of empowerment within the game.

## Gameplay Elements

Collectable dots will be strategically placed, with a clear visual indicator of the player's progress in collecting them. The introduction of multiple levels will provide players with a goal to achieve, creating a sense of accomplishment upon completing each stage.

## Player Controls and Progression

Basic player controls using arrow keys for movement will be implemented, accompanied by realistic collision behaviors with walls, collectables, and enemies. Visual representations of remaining lives and collected dots will be displayed, ensuring players are well-informed about their progress and risks.

## Reset Mechanism

Game progression will involve a reset mechanism after losing a life, allowing players to continue from the beginning of a level while retaining collected dots. A full game reset will occur upon exhausting all lives, providing a challenging yet rewarding experience for players.

## Sound Effects and Nostalgia

Sound effects, including the iconic ghost siren, "waka-waka," and original game music, will be integrated to enhance the nostalgic feel. Our near vision is centered on delivering a functional prototype that captures the essence of the classic Pac-Man experience while laying the foundation for further refinement and expansion.
